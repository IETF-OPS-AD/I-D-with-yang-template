# "Internet-Draft with YANG Modules" Template Repository

Use this repository as a template if you want to start working on
[IETF](https://www.ietf.org/) documents with YANG Modules.

[Click here to create a new repository using the template](https://github.com/IETF-OPS-AD/I-D-with-yang-template/generate).
Make sure to check "Include all branches".

Once you have created your own repository, start work by
[renaming the `draft-todo-yourname-protocol.md` file](../../edit/main/draft-todo-yourname-protocol.md) and adding your YANG files under "yang" folder.

Refer to [I-D-with-yang-template/issues](https://github.com/IETF-OPS-AD/I-D-with-yang-template/issues) if you want to report issues or track candidate features (e.g., add metadata to skip I-D cloning but keep only YANG validation part).

This repository leverages [martinthomson/internet-draft-template](https://github.com/martinthomson/internet-draft-template) to build I-Ds and extends it to provide required tools to support IETF documents which include YANG mdoules.
